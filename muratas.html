          Once I decided to find a road bike that will suit all my requirements.
          And it was actually a pretty challenging task. We have a lot of
          different bike stores. And checking all of them is a real pain. Many
          have very bad UI and filter systems. Finding a required bike takes a
          lot of time and effort. Eventually, I found the bike, but it would be
          much easier if we had some kind of webpage like HV(hinnavaatlus for
          the bikes). Unfortunately, we did not have this kind of service. So I
          decided to create this kind of service.
