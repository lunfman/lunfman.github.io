# Portfolio

## Description
My portfolio landing page. It should have simple minimalistic design and focus on projects and my skills.
Page should show my skills? and let know to potential employees that I am a good candidate. 

## Content
Big projects , Small projects different layout
About me ?! -> goals -> motivation
My skills -> Python, Js, web stack, 
I think it is not a good idea to describe each of my skills . Projects should show my skills! Not icons or text.
My projects
